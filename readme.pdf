This program is a string Tokenizer that takes in a single string of characters of an arbitrary length and breaks them
up into types of inputs. 

There are several types of tokens:
A word token consists of an alphabetic character followed by any number of alphanumeric
characters. Some word tokens are “hi” “stufF” “ThinGs” “a1231” “C0MP14IN”
A decimal integer is a digit character followed by any number of digit characters: “12” “8” “2”
An octal integer is a '0' character followed by any number of octal digits (0-7).
A hexadecimal integer is “0x” (or “0X”) followed by any number of hexadecimal digits (0-9, af, A-F).
A floating point token is a decimal integer that has a '.' at any position other than the last. It may
optionally contain an exponent in scientific notation at the end, for example: “3.14159e-10”
Aditionally, C operators are read as tokens aswell. 

This program reads in the string from left two right and has helper functions to identify the type of token we want to print out. For the C operators a switch statement
containing all of the 45 operators is used instead of a helper function.
